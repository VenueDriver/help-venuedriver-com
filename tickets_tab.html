<p><h1>Tickets Tab.</p></h1>

<p>The Tickets Tab in Venue Driver is where managers and above can create and modify ticketing options for an event, and publish them onto their ticketing page, which is provided at no additional cost to every Venue Driver client. With Venue Driver's integrated ticketing platform, third-party ticketing on through a separate service becomes extraneous and unnecessary. The initial view of the Tickets Tab displays a summary of all ticketed events within an account.</p>

When a ticket is purchased with this value set, a VIP reservation will automatically be made, and approved for the person who purchased the ticket.</p>

<h2>Managing Existing Ticket Sales</h2>.

<p>Venue Driver allows for the client venue or organization to manage their own existing ticket sales without the need to contact Venue Driver Support for routine tasks, including re-sending lost e-tickets to the email on file, or a new email, and viewing/sorting sales for analysis. Each column heading will be defined below. </p>

<p><b>Voiding a ticket purchase</b></p>.

<p>Venue Driver LLC's general ticketing agreement with venues prohibits refunds unless the venue or organization agrees to them on a case-by-case basis in advance. If a ticket is to be voided, the client venue must explicitly authorize the refund with their Venue Driver representative. Tickets will be marked as void in the system and show up as such if they are attempted to be redeemed. Refunds can take up to two weeks to be processed depending on the time of year and the customer's bank. Venue Driver LLC will only refund face value unless an agreement with the client venue to refund the full value of the ticket is reached. In that case, the client venue will be responsible to pay back Venue Driver LLC the loss of the surcharge. Venue Driver will also void tickets that are discovered to be fraudulently purchased, with an attempt to notify the venue prior to the event. Venue Driver will also, on the client venue's behalf, pursue all legal means to prosecute the fraudulent customer. Conversely, Venue Driver will not honor chargebacks with customers dissatisfied with the event, or customers looking for a refund prior to the event date. Repeated voids from the same customer will be treated as abuse of the system, resulting in the customer being blacklisted systemwide. In the event of an event cancellation, the client venue is responsible for notifying Venue Driver of the cancellation. A procedure to handle the cancellation will be worked out with the client venue on a case-by-case basis. For further questions regarding the void process, contact your Venue Driver representative.</p>
