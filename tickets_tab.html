<p><h1>Tickets Tab.</p></h1>

<p>The Tickets Tab in Venue Driver is where managers and above can create and modify ticketing options for an event, and publish them onto their ticketing page, which is provided at no additional cost to every Venue Driver client. With Venue Driver's integrated ticketing platform, third-party ticketing on through a separate service becomes extraneous and unnecessary. The initial view of the Tickets Tab displays a summary of all ticketed events within an account.</p>
