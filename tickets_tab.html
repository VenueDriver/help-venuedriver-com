  <span class='ribbon'>Tickets Tab</span>

<p>The Tickets Tab in Venue Driver is where managers and above can create and modify ticketing options for an event, and publish them onto their ticketing page, which is provided at no additional cost to every Venue Driver client. With Venue Driver's integrated ticketing platform, third-party ticketing on through a separate service becomes extraneous and unnecessary. The initial view of the Tickets Tab displays a summary of all ticketed events within an account.</p>

<h2>Creating and editing a ticket type for sale</h2>

<p>Click the "Create New" Button to create a new ticket type. It is strongly advised creating a new ticket only if the ticket itself grants new privileges to the customer. If it is a price change, create a price change to retain existing ticketing parameters.</p>

<h2>A note on ticket sales with price changes.</h2>

<p>In order to safeguard our client's compliance with local ordinances determining their overall capacity for an event, Venue Driver implements several measures to ensure that ticket sales do not exceed set limits. The primary way with which this becomes visible is when there are leftover ticket sales at a lower price point, and Venue Driver has activated a higher price point. This is due to tickets being placed "on hold" while a purchaser fills out his or her billing and credit card information on our secure purchase form. For example, if a venue puts 400 tickets on sale at $40.00 and 400 tickets on sale at $50.00, they may notice that the lower price point sold 397. What happens is when these tickets are put on hold, they are effectively taken off sale, and in the interim, the active price point may have gone to the next available level. In high-volume sales situations, this difference can be even more noticeable, with many tens of tickets at a price point remaining unsold. The ticket purchaser sees this in the sense that when they go to final check-out, the price may have jumped already. However, if they are on our secure purchase form, they will be able to purchase tickets at the lower price point. However, if they exceed the two-minute hold time, their purchase will not go through and they will be forced to purchase tickets at the higher active price point. <b>Venue Driver LLC will not credit customers for the difference in price, as this occurrence is not representative of a malfunction.</b></p>

<p>The alternative is that the system would oversell tickets due to the sales on hold, leading to an oversold event, which exposes Venue Driver LLC to liability. Thus, "underselling" is the only recourse, to protect both Venue Driver LLC and the client.</p>
<p>
If a client wishes to sell the full allocation of tickets, they can merely add the "missing" quantity to the last price point for an event ticket sale. So, if 397 tickets were sold at $40.00, and 400 were sold at $50.00, one can merely add the 3 "missing" tickets to the $50.00 price point to allow for a complete sale.</p>

<p>Still another alternative is to create each price point as a separate ticket type and manually activate them as a sale progresses. Venue Driver includes an email notification checkbox in a user's staff profile to notify him or her of a sold-out condition on a show. The disadvantage of this method is that ticket purchasers may see a "sold-out" message temporarily while a new price point is placed online.</p>

<h2>Managing Existing Ticket Sales</h2>

<p>Venue Driver allows for the client venue or organization to manage their own existing ticket sales without the need to contact Venue Driver Support for routine tasks, including re-sending lost e-tickets to the email on file, or a new email, and viewing/sorting sales for analysis. Each column heading will be defined below. </p>

<p><b>Voiding a ticket purchase</b>
<br/>
Venue Driver LLC's general ticketing agreement with venues prohibits refunds unless the venue or organization agrees to them on a case-by-case basis in advance. If a ticket is to be voided, the client venue must explicitly authorize the refund with their Venue Driver representative. Tickets will be marked as void in the system and show up as such if they are attempted to be redeemed. Refunds can take up to two weeks to be processed depending on the time of year and the customer's bank. Venue Driver LLC will only refund face value unless an agreement with the client venue to refund the full value of the ticket is reached. In that case, the client venue will be responsible to pay back Venue Driver LLC the loss of the surcharge. Venue Driver will also void tickets that are discovered to be fraudulently purchased, with an attempt to notify the venue prior to the event. Venue Driver will also, on the client venue's behalf, pursue all legal means to prosecute the fraudulent customer. Conversely, Venue Driver will not honor chargebacks with customers dissatisfied with the event, or customers looking for a refund prior to the event date. Repeated voids from the same customer will be treated as abuse of the system, resulting in the customer being blacklisted systemwide. In the event of an event cancellation, the client venue is responsible for notifying Venue Driver of the cancellation. A procedure to handle the cancellation will be worked out with the client venue on a case-by-case basis. For further questions regarding the void process, contact your Venue Driver representative.</p>
