  <span class='ribbon'>Entering returns into Venue Driver</span>

<p>Venue Driver allows for comprehensive tracking of VIP customer spends and guestlist returns. This data is then passed onto the Staff Performance section and also the Customers tab. Guestlist returns can either be entered automatically via the iOS app or web interface check-in, or manually in this returns section. VIP customer spends can be entered manually during or after an event. Automated VIP spend tracking via an add-on POS interface will be deploying in the latter half of 2011.</p>
</div>

<p>To access the returns for a given date, select the date using the calendar icon in the upper left-hand corner of the browser window.</p>
