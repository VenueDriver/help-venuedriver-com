  <p><h1>Events Tab</h1></p>

<p>The Events Tab in Venue Driver is where the user can enter and list the events at their venue, as well as input and view VIP reservation and guestlist returns. If the venue's website is integrated with Venue Driver, events entered here will list on the public website of the venue. Which fields list on the public website are determined at the time of integration. Web-based check-in functions can be accessed here as well.</p>

<p>Venue Driver allows for the client to upload flyers and other graphical assets to the system. JPGs and GIF files will display on the venue's ticketing page and/or public website if integration has been done. The most recently uploaded flyer is what will be displayed. File formats such as PDF can be uploaded, allowing staff to download them at their convenience, but these will not display on the ticketing page or public website. To upload, click "Create New" and select the file to be uploaded.</p>


<h2>Passes</h2>

<img src="/images/passes.png">

<p>Scannable passes can be created on a per-event basis in Venue Driver. The pass is an alphanumeric code that can be of your choosing or generated randomly by the system. The pass can signify anything the venue wishes it to signify, such as complimentary admission, or half-off cover, for example. The barcode itself can be generated by copying and pasting the alphanumeric code into the following page. <a href="http://www.barcoding.com/upc/">Barcode Generator</a> Barcode type is 128.</p>
