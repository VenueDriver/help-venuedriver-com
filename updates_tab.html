  <span class='ribbon'>Updates Tab</span>
  <p>The Updates tab in Venue Driver is where promoters, hosts, managers, and administrators go to see a summary of recent activity within their account. Two different views are available, depending on access level. Managers and administrators will see a summary of account activity, and VIP Hosts and promoters will only see their own performance figures. All users will also see their custom ticket affiliate link, which they can copy and paste to email blasts, blogs, and social media web applications to sell tickets and receive credit for those sales.</p>
