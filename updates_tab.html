  <p>The Updates tab in Venue Driver is where promoters, hosts, managers, and administrators go to see a summary of recent activity within their account. Two different views are available, depending on access level. Managers and administrators will see a summary of account activity, and VIP Hosts and promoters will only see their own performance figures.</p>
