<div class='block white'>

    In this section   tdate range can be set for viewing performance. Please note that depending on the date range requested, the data might take a few moments to display.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Pass Statistics</b><br />
    This is where a staff mem  erpass returns are tracked. A pass is generated in the Events tab for an event, or is also tracked by the Tally function in the iOS app.

<img src="/images/affiliate.png">

<p>Venue Driver allows for staff members' ticket sales and guestlist/reservation form performance (available to API-integrated clients only) to be tracked via a unique affiliate code. To view the full URL for tracking, click on the code to bring up a new browser tab with the full URL. Affiliate code sales and performance are available in the Reports tab.</p>

<h2>A note on deleting users.</h2>

<!-- put close-up of delete button screenshot here -->

<img src="/images/delete.png">

<p>Administrators and managers are allowed to delete users of lesser rank than themselves. Deleting a user removes them from the system but keeps their data intact. However, the data will not be associated with the user since his or her record will no longer exist. Venue Driver recommends instead that when an employee's access needs to be revoked, that his or her password and email are changed, thereby retaining the associations in the account's database.</p>
