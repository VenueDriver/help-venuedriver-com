<p>When setting up a login for a new user, there are several options available, which will be detailed below.</p>

<p><b>Username</b></p>

<p>This is the username of the venue employee who needs Venue Driver access. This name is unique to the Venue Driver system as a whole. Venue Driver will prompt if the username requested has been taken.</p>

<p><b>Last</b></p>

<p>This is the user's last (family) name.</p>

<p><b>First</b></p>

<p>This is the user's first (given) name. This is a required field.</p>

<p><b>Job Title</b></p>
<p>This is the user's job description.</p>

<p><b>Email</b></p>
<p>This is where the user's email is entered. This is a required field and the email must be unique to Venue Driver as a whole. Venue Driver will prompt if the email is in use.</p>

<p><b>Phone</b></p>
<p>The user's phone number can be entered here.</p>

<p><b>Password</b></p>
<p>Enter the user's password here. While Venue Driver does not enforce password complexity rules, it is generally good practice to make a password sufficiently complex to deter security issues. For example, "1234" is not a strong password, while "e4nt3rpr1z@" is. Password must be entered twice for verification.</p>
