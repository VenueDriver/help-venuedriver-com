<p><h1>Customers Tab</h1></p>

<p>The Customers Tab in Venue Driver is the "master database" of customer and guest data for an account. Only managers and administrators have access to this function. Any names from a reservation, guestlist, or ticket purchase will appear in this tab, along with the activity and monetary spends of the customer in question. In addition, customers can be created directly in the Customers tab. Contacts from the Contact form feature on the iOS app will also end up here, under the Contact Group "Data Collection". The Customers tab also includes a Google-like comprehensive search feature which will return results based on any search term.</p>
