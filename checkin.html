To access this, click the 'Check-in' button by the event in question.</p>

<p>When a guest shows up to the event, click the "Checked In" checkbox to check them in. If the venue is equipped with a Venue Driver-supplied thermal printer, a chit will be printed which can be handed off to a runner, host, or waiter/waitress. Clicking "Seating" will allow for some attributes of a reservation to be edited, such as where a client is sat, and so on.</p>

<h2>Checking in Guestlist customers</h2>

<p>If a venue chooses to use the Tally function, it is accessible here. The Tally will credit each promoter with a Pass entry, but no data from the customer is captured.</p>

<h2>Tables</h2>

<!-- show the tables tab. -->

<p>In this tab, a list of tables is presented, and who is sat at them. Opening a table by clicking the "Open" button allows it to be booked for another reservation that evening. Clicking "Hold" will reserve a table without explicitly putting a reservation for it. Clicking "Notes" will allow notes to be made about that reservation.</p>

<h2>Tickets</h2>

<div id ="images">

</div>
<br/>
<p>In this tab, a list of ticketed customers is presented with various data fields. Tickets can be redeemed either by typing in the code in the "Redeem Ticket" box, clicking "Redeem", or by using a USB scanner wand supplied by Venue Driver. All columns are sortable.</p>
<br/>

<div class="block white">

<br/>
This is the ticket code.</p>

<p><b>First</b>

The last name of the customer.</p>

<p><b>Mobile Phone</b>

<p><b>Quantity</b>
<br/>
The amount of tickets bought under that specific code. Up to 4.</p>

<p><b>Void</b>
<br/>	
This will notate if the ticket in question has been voided. If the ticket has been voided, it is not suitable for entry into an event.</p>

<p><b>Redeemed</b>
<br/>
This will show the amount of tickets on a code that have been redeemed thus far.</p>

<p><b>Redeem</b>
<br/>
Click this button to redeem a ticket.</p>

<p><b>Unredeem</b>
<br/>
Click this button to unredeem a ticket.</p>

<p><b>Create New</b>
<!-- focus on the Create New. -->
<br/>
Venue Driver offers the ability to create "walk-up" tickets. Click the "Create New" button to create a walk up ticket. The data being filled out is all optional, except for quantity. This will then generate a printable chit with a barcode which then can be scanned with either the USB wand or a Venue Driver-supplied iPod touch scanning unit. Please note these tickets are not tied into the financial processing system of Venue Driver and funds must be collected separately.</p>
